README:::

The project is a coding challenge in order to be recruted with Hidden Founder 
The project is about implementing an app that lists shops nearby.

As a User, I can sign up using my email & password
As a User, I can sign in using my email & password
As a User, I can display the list of shops sorted by distance
As a User, I can like a shop, so it can be added to my preferred shops
Acceptance criteria: liked shops shouldn’t be displayed on the main page
Bonus point (those items are optional):

[BONUS] As a User, I can dislike a shop, so it won’t be displayed within “Nearby Shops” list during the next 2 hours
[BONUS] As a User, I can display the list of preferred shops
[BONUS] As a User, I can remove a shop from my preferred shops list

You normally if are using a localhost you need to get to this URL if you are a Developer: http://localhost/challenge/web/app_dev.php/

Note that We have changed the 2 hours dislike delay to 20 seconds in order to see the changes in real time.I tried using changin database in Controller adding a DO SLEEP () 
but it makes the website blocked and waiting for the period of time in order to change the value of the Database.So I have choosen using Javascript instead.
